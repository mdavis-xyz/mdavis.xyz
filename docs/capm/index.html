      <p>Energy retailers face two main risks:</p>
<p><strong>Price Risk</strong>: Retailers offer customers a fixed price,
and are exposed to a variable spot price</p>
<p><strong>Quantity Risk</strong>: Customers may consume more or less
quantity than expected</p>
<p>The interaction between these two risks is crucial. For example, a
retailer may invest in a solar farm to hedge long term trends in
electricity spot prices. However, even if the daily volume of energy
(MWh) consumed by customers equals the daily volume of energy generated
by the solar farm, the retailer is still exposed to <em>shape risk</em>.
If customers mostly consume in the evenings, after the sun has set, the
solar investment cannot hedge that consumption, so the retailer is left
with a short position for those hours. (This shape risk exists for other
generator types, such as coal, which typically produces an output that
varies within a day by less than a typical customer.)</p>
<p>Many businesses consume most of their power during daylight hours,
when the spot price of electricity is low. A typical household may
consume much of their power around dinnertime (when spot prices are
high), and almost none during midday when cheap solar power is abundant,
because the occupants are not home. However, a household with a remote
worker may consume a greater portion of their consumption during the
middle of the day, when spot prices tend to be low, thus making them
more profitable for retailers (for the same retail price).</p>
<p>The following graphs show the price, quantity and cost for two
customer types. Prices were taken for a typical day in August 2025, NSW.
The &quot;Original&quot; load curve matches the shape of the actual aggregate
demand in the region that day (normalised to a mean of 1 MW). The
&quot;Shifted&quot; load curve is identical, but is shifted in time by 4 hours, so
that the demand peaks align with price minimums, not price maximums.
This change in correlation slightly reduces the average cost, and
substantially reduces the variance of the cost throughout the day. In
particular, the breakfast (7am) and dinnertime (6pm) peaks are
substantially smaller with the &quot;Shifted&quot; customer. (The same effect
should apply on a longer term. A period of one day was chosen for visual
clarity.) Avoiding big price spikes is a top concern for risk-averse
retailers.</p>

<p>Suppose that retailers are able to discriminate based on these
different types of customers (e.g. through targeted advertising, a front
book/back book spread, bundling with other products). Some customers
have consumption profiles which happen to be strongly and positively
correlated with price, others are weakly correlated, and some may even
be negatively correlated.</p>
<p>I have constructed a stylised theoretical model to examine which mix
of customers is optimal. Suppose retailers choose a mix of low-risk
low-return customers, and high-risk, high-return customers. The
algebraic derivations are in my <a href="../masters-thesis">masters
thesis</a>. The key take-away is that the expected profit of a portfolio
is linear in terms of the fraction of high vs low risk customers, and
the variance of profit is quadratic. This is qualitatively the same
tradeoff as for an investor in the standard <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model">capital
asset pricing model (CAPM)</a>. (However, the algebra differs
slightly.)</p>

<p>Retailers cannot easily hedge against customer <em>quantity</em>
risk, but they can try to hedge price risk by investing in generation
(which has its own quantity risk). The short and long positions (with
respect to spot price) of consumers and generators complement each other
more so than between customers of different types. This leads to more
strongly bent pairwise frontiers in the following diagram between
generator and customer than between two customer types. Generators with
daily output profiles most closely matching a given customer type are
the strongest hedging pairs (most bent pairwise frontiers).</p>

<p>The contribution of this model is to highlight the similarities
between an investor choosing an optimal portfolio of assets, and a
retailer targeting customers with different daily load shapes. More
details are included as a section in my <a
href="../masters-thesis">masters thesis</a>.</p>
