      <p>&quot;Colocation&quot; refers to installing batteries and solar (or wind)
together at the same site.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Solar panel and battery

</figure>
</div>
<p>When examining the benefits of colocation, many investors, grid
operators and policy makers choose a solar project without batteries as
the alternative to compare to.</p>
<div class="wiring">
<figure>
<img src="wiring-svgs/solar-only.svg" alt="Solar only" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Solar only</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Given the high upfront cost of batteries, a more suitable
counterfactual is that of solar and batteries installed at separate
locations, possibly by separate companies.</p>
<div class="wiring">
<figure>
<img src="wiring-svgs/separate.svg"
alt="Solar and battery, separate installations" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Solar and battery, separate
installations</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>From this perspective, there are many practical benefits of battery
colocation. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one network connection is needed. This matters because grid
connections are often scarce, and costly to acquire (<a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914004668">Zhao
et al., 2015</a>).</li>
<li>Network charges, charges for ancillary services, and dispatch target
deviations due to weather forecast errors can be improved through
co-optimising (<a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X21003121">Yang
et al., 2021</a>, <a
href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8730659">Ma et al.,
2019</a>).</li>
<li>There are efficiencies of scale for project management.
e.g. Electricians only need to visit one site to maintain both panels
and batteries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many researchers and industry participants conflate these benefits
with the direct spot-revenue impact of charging a battery from solar. <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622034795">Naemi
et al. (2022)</a>, <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914004668">Zhao
et al. (2015)</a> and <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X18303803">Wong
et al. (2019)</a> suggest that batteries help solar (or wind) generators
store power when the sun is shining and prices are cheap, and discharge
it later when prices are higher. Whilst this 'solar sponge' approach
does yield higher revenue than a solar farm without a battery, it also
costs more to build. Conditional on buying a battery, it is not obvious
whether colocation has any impact on pure spot revenue, compared to a
solar farm and battery installed separately.</p>
<p>As an example, a common argument is that when spot prices go negative
(or below zero minus the subsidy price) a colocated project can charge
the battery for free using on-site solar generation, without wasting
that sunlight or paying to export. However, in such a situation it would
be more profitable to withhold the solar generation (waste sunlight) and
get paid to charge from the grid at the negative price. This is exactly
how separate batteries and solar would behave (either if owned by the
same company, or separate companies). Therefore I argue that
time-shifting renewable power to increase revenue (or decrease
emissions) is not a valid argument in favour of colocation. That would
happen without colocation.</p>
<p>The purpose of this post is to extend <a href="../solar-tilt">my
model about vertical solar panels</a> to investigate the impact of
colocation on spot market revenue. The angle at which solar panels are
installed is an investment decision, and the charging schedule of the
battery is an operational decision. I will investigate whether
colocating batteries with solar changes the optimal angle which panels
should be installed at, the optimal battery charging revenue, or total
spot market revenue. The logistical considerations mentioned above will
be neglected for this model. They may be significant factors which make
colocation the right choice. However it is important that investors are
precise about why they are choosing colocation. The purpose of this post
is to focus on spot market revenue.</p>
<p>Upfront investment costs will be neglected, since they would be
approximately the same with both colocation and separate sites
(neglecting project management efficiencies from having only one site).
It is assumed that the grid connection is not constrained. This analysis
applies to large scale projects, because I assume revenue is based on
spot price. For households with solar and a battery, the same principles
would apply, were they not distorted by fixed tariffs.</p>
<p>This work is part of my <a href="../masters-thesis">masters
thesis</a>.</p>
<h2 id="solar-with-a-battery-which-can-charge-from-the-grid">Solar With
a Battery Which Can Charge From the Grid</h2>
<p>This model builds on <a href="../solar-tilt">my stylised model about
vertical solar panels</a>. The relevant points are that:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 3 time periods:
<ul>
<li>Midday (T<sub>1</sub>)</li>
<li>Afternoon (T<sub>2</sub>)</li>
<li>Evening (T<sub>3</sub>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prices are low, medium and high respectively (p<sub>1</sub> &lt;
p<sub>2</sub> &lt; p<sub>3</sub>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This reflects a typical daily price curve, where plentiful sunlight
drives prices low around midday, and then prices increase throughout the
latter half of the day as solar power becomes more scarce and demand
increases.</p>
<p>For this post, I will just look at the 'vertical' case from that
other model. This means the panels produce δ of power in T<sub>2</sub>
(0 &lt; δ &lt; 1), and 0 in the other time periods. (For the more
conventional case of panels oriented to produce maximum output at
midday, the details are in <a href="../masters-thesis">my thesis</a>.
The conclusion is the same.)</p>
<div class="graph">
<figure>
<img src="charge-time/1-solar-only.svg" alt="Solar only" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Solar only</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Now suppose that we add a battery. The operator faces the choice of
whether to immediately export solar power when it is generated, or store
it for later. Most people say that we should charge the battery from the
solar power (if the price increase between periods 2 and 3 is more than
the round trip loss of storage).</p>
<div class="graph">
<figure>
<img src="charge-time/2-solar-charge-no-arb.svg"
alt="Battery charged from solar, with no arbitrage" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Battery charged from solar, with no
arbitrage</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This has increased the total revenue. However this is not the maximum
profit we can obtain. In this model I sized the battery to be slightly
larger than what the solar panel produces. (The findings still hold if
this is not the case. However the explanation is clearer if we use this
setup.) Suppose that in T<sub>2</sub> we charge the battery from solar,
<em>and</em> also charge from the grid to fill up remaining space in the
battery.</p>
<div class="graph">
<figure>
<img src="charge-time/3-solar-charge-with-arb-2.svg"
alt="Battery charged from solar, with arbitrage in period 2" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Battery charged from solar, with
arbitrage in period 2</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Charging from the grid as well as from solar has increased our spot
market profit. However this is still not the maximum profit we can make.
We can charge from the grid in the prior period, when the price is
lower. This reduces our charging cost.</p>
<div class="graph">
<figure>
<img src="charge-time/4-solar-charge-with-arb-1.svg"
alt="Battery charged from solar, arbitrage in period 1" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Battery charged from solar, arbitrage in
period 1</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>However this is <em>still</em> not the strategy which gives the
maximum revenue. People often think that since we're charging the
battery from our own solar then the charge cost is zero. This is not
quite true. If we did not put that solar into the battery we would have
instead sold it for p<sub>2</sub>. Therefore the opportunity cost of
charging from solar is p<sub>2</sub>. Is there a way to charge the
battery for a cost lower than p<sub>2</sub>? Yes! We can charge in
T<sub>1</sub> for p<sub>1</sub>. We can charge the battery completely
from the grid in T<sub>1</sub>, then export the solar power when we
generate it in T<sub>2</sub>, then discharge the stored grid power in
T<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<div class="graph">
<figure>
<img src="charge-time/5-solar-export-with-arb.svg"
alt="Battery charged from grid, solar immediately exported" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Battery charged from grid, solar
immediately exported</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This is the strategy which maximizes revenue for this setup. Note
that this is the same as the strategy which maximizes profit if the
solar panels and battery are installed in separate locations (even if
they are owned by separate companies). So the best we can hope to
achieve when the battery and solar panels are together is the same as
what we would get if they were installed separately. Therefore
colocating batteries and solar on the same site compared to different
sites does not improve spot revenue. In simpler terms, moving a battery
and solar farm together, such that charging from solar is no longer an
explicit expense, does not eliminate the opportunities and opportunity
costs of supplying and consuming from the spot market.</p>
<p>In practice many projects are configured such that the battery can
only charge from the solar panels, and not from the grid. This reduces
spot revenue by reducing the set of possible arbitrage strategies. This
restriction is typically due to both regulatory and technical reasons.
These may be sound reasons, however anecdotally it seems that there is
not wide recognition of the extent to which an inability to charge from
the grid reduces spot market profit.</p>
<p>Colocation may still be the best choice overall, especially if
network connections are difficult to acquire. However it is important to
be precise about what the benefits of colocation are. Acting as a 'solar
sponge' to shift cheap, clean sunlight from midday to higher priced
evenings is not a benefit, because that would happen with separate
installations anyway.</p>
<p>This idea is explored more comprehensively in <a
