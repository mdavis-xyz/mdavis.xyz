      <p>In a typical electricity spot market time is divided up into discrete
periods or intervals. Within these intervals prices are constant. There
are discontinuous steps at the boundaries between trading intervals.
However, to maintain the stability of the electrical grid, the physical
power output of generators (and storage) based on these discontinuous
prices are not themselves discontinuous. Rather, the quantity obtained
for each generator from the intersection of supply and demand curves is
used as a target that the generator must move towards, over time. In
Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM) generators must take the
entire period to adjust their output, even if they could physically
adjust more quickly (<a
href="https://energy-rules.aemc.gov.au/ner/621/526154#clause_4.9.2">NER
Clause 4.9.2</a>). This means that prices are
piecewise-<em>constant</em>, or 'step' functions, but quantities are
'diagonal' piecewise-<em>linear</em> 'dot-to-dot' functions. Papers such
as <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378779610000027">Xia
and Elaiw (2010)</a> and <a
href="https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1049/iet-gtd.2020.1329">Wei
et al. (2020)</a> consider physical limits on ramp rates (production
level adjustment rates) arising from technical limitations of each
generator, and how this impacts bidding strategies and social optimums.
In contrast, this post considers limits imposed by the market operator
(<a href="https://aemo.com.au/">AEMO</a>) which may restrict adjustment
speed to rates slower than what the asset can physically do. This
distinction is most relevant for batteries.</p>
<p>Consider the following example prices. The price starts above a
generator's marginal cost (&quot;MC&quot;, assumed to be bid truthfully), drops
below, and then rises back up.</p>
<div class="graph">
<figure>
<img src="graphs/price.svg" alt="Prices over time" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Prices over time</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Under standard economic assumptions the generator and the social
planner (i.e. AEMO) want the generator to instantaneously reduce power
output to 0% at the start of period 2.</p>
<div class="graph">
<figure>
<img src="graphs/power-1.svg" alt="Stepped power over time" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Stepped power over time</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>However, to ensure grid stability AEMO will instead instruct the
generator to ramp diagonally from its starting power level (100% in this
case) to 0, over the interval (shown as the <span
style="color: #FF0000;">red</span> curve). The same is true of scheduled
loads and storage. Note that this is true even for assets which are
physically able to adjust production level almost instantly (e.g. solar,
batteries). (For coal and gas, the ramp limits imposed by the physical
limitations of the equipment are already substantial on a 5-minute
timescale.)</p>
<div class="graph">
<figure>
<img src="graphs/power-2.svg" alt="Diagonal power over time" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Diagonal power over time</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Consequently, the <span style="color: #FF0000;">red</span> curve has
an average power of 50% over interval 2, so it is 'half-on', despite
having a bid higher than the cleared price. This means that the
generator is losing money in interval 2, and missing out on money in
interval 4. The following table shows the revenue for the theoretical
&quot;stepped&quot; and more realistic &quot;diagonal&quot; curves, based on the example
prices above, for a 1 MW generator and 5 minute intervals.</p>

<p>This requirement that the generator take the entire period to ramp to
the target power level reduces generator profit in this stylised example
by 20%. (For an asset which is physically capable of ramping far
faster.) The generator in this example would make more profit by
strategically lowering their bid in interval 2 below marginal cost, to
ensure they are fully on in interval 4.</p>

<p>A contribution of this post is to show that even in the absence of
market power, startup costs, <em>physical</em> ramp rate limits, and
with perfect foresight of prices, rational profit-maximising firms
should submit bids which do not match their marginal costs. This novel
finding illustrates how simplified analysis using stepped power levels
yields qualitatively incorrect conclusions about optimal strategies.</p>
<p>Whilst this insight is most pertinent for batteries, it can apply to
other fuel types too. In my previous job I designed an algorithm to
submit bids for a wind farm which was physically capable of ramping by a
substantial fraction of its nameplate capacity within a 5 minute
interval. I had to account for this effect, rebidding to deliberately
<em>avoid</em> ramping down and then back up when the price dips below
marginal cost for only one period.</p>
<h2 id="simulations">Simulations</h2>
<p>The aim of this section is to determine whether the use of the
&quot;stepped&quot; approach in academic or investment modelling introduces
material errors. For coal, gas, hydro and wind, the asset typically
cannot adjust its power level within a trading period, so any modeller
should already be considering dynamic constraints. However many
researchers use the step model for battery analysis (e.g. <a
href="https://tintin.hec.ca/pages/mario.samano/EECC/Lecture-4/Batteries_Lamp_Samano_EneEcon_published.pdf">Lamp
and Samano 2022</a>; <a
href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.5547/01956574.39.SI1.mgiu">Giulietti
et al. 2018</a>). The next section explores when and to what extent this
simplification is an <em>over</em>-simplification. To do so, I
constructed a simple battery operation optimisation problem, using real
price data, and then I compared the energy, revenue and cycles for both
the diagonal and stepped power levels.</p>
<p>5-minute spot prices were obtained from <a
href="https://www.nemweb.com.au/Data_Archive/Wholesale_Electricity/MMSDM/2025/MMSDM_2025_01/MMSDM_Historical_Data_SQLLoader/DATA/">AEMO's
Nemweb</a> with <a
href="https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/NEMOSIS/">Nemosis</a>. The analysis
period is 2024. The battery is sized at 1 MW, 2 hours depth, with 80%
round trip efficiency. Perfect foresight is assumed. <a
href="https://www.pyomo.org/about">Pyomo</a> (a linear optimiser) was
used to identify the optimal charge and discharge schedule to maximise
energy arbitrage revenue. Ancillary service revenue and other 'revenue
stacking' is neglected (despite making up <a
href="https://doi.org/10.5547/01956574.45.1.jgil">approximately half of
battery revenue</a> in practice) because the linear constraint in
question only applies to energy.</p>
<p>Here is a subset of the time series results:</p>

<p>Note that the &quot;stepped&quot; approach yields many single-period power
spikes, which are not realistic. The diagonal approach is a more

<p>The absolute level of each metric is unimportant for our purposes.
The key question is merely whether there is an economically significant
difference between the stepped and diagonal models. For the total amount
of energy stored, and the profit made by batteries, the impact of
neglecting the diagonal constraint is that the numbers are inflated by
up to 4.5%. This is large enough to be consequential for some academic
research questions. Note that these simulations ran faster with the
diagonal ramping than without, so computational feasibility is probably
not a valid justification for ignoring diagonal ramping. Therefore
researchers should account for the piecewise-linear constraint unless
they have a good reason not to.</p>
<p>For practitioners, this reduction in profitability is so economically
significant that it may make or break the business case for a particular
investment. The total amount of energy stored and discharged is lower in
the diagonal case. As a silver lining, this corresponds to fewer full
cycles, which is good from a warranty perspective.</p>
<p>When accounting for the diagonal piecewise-linear constraint, the
optimal charge/discharge strategy is more smooth, and has fewer
single-interval dips/spikes.</p>
<h2 id="model">Model</h2>
<p>In my <a href="../masters-thesis">masters thesis</a> I present an
algebraic model, to demonstrate that the effect of this diagonal
constraint is that for a given trading interval, each generator 'sees'
an average of the current and prior price. This effectively suppresses
the economic signal in a single-interval price spike/dip.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-to-europe">Comparison to Europe</h2>
<p>In Europe, prior to 2011 there were no rules specifying how
generators were to adjust output within each trading period, as long as
the average physical output each period matched the commercial target.
This resulted in deterministic imbalances at the start of each hour,
which <a
href="https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/pre2015/publications/entsoe/120222_Deterministic_Frequency_Deviations_joint_ENTSOE_Eurelectric_Report__Final_.pdf">increased
costs and emissions</a>. Since then the rules around balancing have
changed. For example, the transmission lines connecting the Nordic
regions to the rest of Europe are required to adjust their output <a
href="https://consultations.entsoe.eu/system-operations/nordic-tsos-methodology-for-ramping-restrictions-f/supporting_documents/230130%20Explanatory%20Document%20for%20Ramping%20restrictions%20for%20active%20power%20output%20amended%20for%20public%20consultation.pdf">over
10 minute blocks</a>, to help mitigate these deterministic imbalances.
Europe's balancing rules are relatively complicated compared to other
markets, and vary from country to country. The findings of this
simulation cannot be directly applied to Europe. It might or might not
be the case that investors and researchers should account for such
ramping rules in their modelling.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Even if an asset such as a solar farm or battery is able to adjust
its power output within seconds, AEMO requires that they take the entire
5 minute period to do so. This leads to an economically significant
reduction in profit. Therefore academic researchers and investors
looking at Australia's NEM should account for this diagonal dispatch
constraint in their modelling.</p>
