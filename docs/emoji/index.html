      <p>A <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/deadlyblackz/photos/a.313232015502924/594797694013020/?type=3&amp;theater">recent
viral post</a> is asking Apple to add the Aboriginal flag to the iPhone
emoji keyboard, as an addition to the other flags already there.</p>
<div class="center imageCont">
<p><img
      id="narrowImage"
      src="images/original-printscreen.jpg"
      width=653
      height=960
      alt="Printscreen of the post, asking Apple to add the Indigenous flag"
   /></p>
</div>
<p>The text of the post is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can everyone please share this picture! Make it get to Apple! it is
the only flag not there</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like activism as much as the next person, but only when it is aimed
at the people who can fix the problem. Upon seeing this post, I
initially suspected that it was aimed at the wrong people, since Apple
do not choose what the set of available emojis is. So I looked up how
emojis are decided. My initial guess was that this petition should be
aimed at the Unicode standards body. It turns out the flag emojis'
encodings and governance are even more complex than other emojis. This
means that even the Unicode standards body may not be able to add the
Indigenous flag.</p>
<p>Apple do not decide which emojis to include. They simply implement
the Unicode standard (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">ISO/IEC 10646</a>). There
is a surprising amount of wiggle room for vendors implementing emojis,
but that is still just restricted to minor creative details. For
example, are the flags wavy or a perfect rectangle? Is the &quot;gun&quot; an
actual gun <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/25/google-gun-emoji-switch-water-pistol-android-update-apple">or
a water pistol</a>?</p>
<p>It turns out that the Unicode standard itself does not actually
define the list of flags to be included as emojis. This is because the
people who design emojis think that they should not bear the politically
heavy responsibility of deciding what is a country and what is not. An
Aboriginal flag is uncontroversial. However other more controversial
proposals could follow. Whether or not <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Sealand">Sealand</a>
should be legitimised through the creation of a Sealand flag emoji is a
controversial and politically heavy question. That decision should not
be made by a small (and slow) group of typography nerds choosing glyphs
and encodings. This is why the Unicode standard does not actually
specify the list of flag emojis.</p>
<p>Unlike most other emojis the flags are encoded with reference to
another standard, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">ISO 3166-1</a>.
This is the country code standard, which defines that &quot;AU&quot; <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements">stands
for</a> Australia. However it gets even more complicated, because that
standard does not define what a country is, it just maps the codes to
the <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html">list of
countries recognised by the UN</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html">Here</a> is
how <em>that</em> list is decided:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a general rule, the ISO 3166 maintenance agency does not assign
official country code elements to other geopolitical areas or countries
that are not member states of the UN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some exceptions, such as states and territories of UN
member nations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, the ISO 3166 maintenance agency may assign country codes to
dependencies of countries that are member states of the UN. To be
considered, some criteria, amongst others, include that the area be
physically separated from its parent country and outside its territorial
waters. Even if all criteria are met, the ISO 3166 maintenance agency
may decide not to assign a code element, for example, due to the very
limited number of official alpha-2 code elements available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nation represented by the Aboriginal flag is not a member of the
UN (at least, not a member distinct from the nominal Australian member).
It is also not physically separate. Therefore it cannot be added to this
list without a change in those rules. So it turns out that implementing
the Aboriginal flag emoji is surprisingly complicated.</p>
<section id="option-1" class="card">
<h2>Option 1</h2>
<p>Petition the UN to recognise Indigenous Australia as a sovereign
nation distinct from colonial Australia. That is a huge ask politically
and legally when the goal is just to have an emoji.</p>
</section>
<section id="option-2" class="card">
<h2>Option 2</h2>
<p>Petition the UN to recognise Indigenous Australia as a &quot;subdivision&quot;
of colonial Australia. Again the same issues arise.</p>
</section>
<section id="option-3" class="card">
<h2>Option 3</h2>
<p>If they really wanted to, Apple <em>could</em> use the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#User-assigned_code_elements">&quot;user
assigned&quot;</a> namespace in ISO 3166-1 to define a non-standard code.
However then when that emoji is viewed on any device which isn't the
latest apple device, it would just appear as the letters &quot;XA&quot; (or &quot;XB&quot;,
&quot;XC&quot; etc) inside circles. Or worse, that second device might already
have that custom code assigned, so it would actually appear as the
<em>wrong</em> flag. (This is why standards exist in the first
place.)</p>
</section>
<section id="option-4" class="card">
<h2>Option 4</h2>
<p>Petition the Unicode standards body to implement the Aboriginal flag
encoding in a unique way which is completely different to every other
national flag. Perhaps a new category could be created for flags which
are not UN member flags. An Aboriginal flag is politically
uncontroversial. However I'm sure other more controversial proposals
would follow, such as the Confederate flag. Such a new category would
grant this small (and slow) group of typography nerds the power and
responsibility to make political decisions and impose an ideological
viewpoint on the whole the world. They do not want to be put in that
position.</p>
</section>
<section id="option-5" class="card">
<h2>Option 5</h2>
<p>There is precedent for a flag emoji implemented which is not in the
UN recognised country list. The rainbow flag emoji!</p>
<div class="center imageCont">
<p><img
      id="rainbow"
      src="images/rainbow.png"
      width=136
      height=127
      alt="The rainbow flag emoji"
   /></p>
</div>
<p>It turns out that this emoji is also not a direct definition in the
Unicode standard. Instead it uses an <a
href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16183-rainbow-flag.pdf">&quot;emoji
special width joiner sequence&quot;</a>. It takes a white flag shape, and a
rainbow, and overlaps them using a zero width joiner character. The main
vendors have hard coded this sequence to render with horizontal stripes
instead of a semicircle. However the sequence is deliberately designed
so that older platforms can still render something legible.</p>
<div class="center imageCont">
<p><img
      id="rainbow-eq"
      src="images/rainbow-eq.jpg"
      width=511
      height=97
      alt="The component glyphs which make up the rainbow emoji"
   /></p>
</div>
<p>I do not know much about the implementation of multi-character
glyphs. I suspect that if you could find an emoji that happens to be a
yellow circle, and another which happens to be half a red rectangle, and
another which happens to be half a black rectangle, you might be able to
join them in this way. If such component emojis already exist then you
could join them up today. You wouldn't need to wait for a slow standards
body. However I doubt such component emojis exist. (Why would anyone
need half a red rectangle as an emoji?)</p>
</section>
<p>In addition to the issue of country recognition, there is also the
issue of <em>licensing</em>. The Aboriginal flag is <a
href="https://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/1997/215.html">copyrighted
by a single individual</a>. Creating an Aboriginal flag emoji would
probably require the license holder to move the flag into the public
domain. For context, the current licensee <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/11/company-that-holds-aboriginal-flag-rights-part-owned-by-man-prosecuted-for-selling-fake-art">litigates
against Indigenous-owned companies who use the flag</a>, so a move into
public domain is unlikely. Instead, there would probably be a special
license agreement created specifically for this emoji. This would
require billions of people across tens of billions of devices to agree
to the license. Imagine if you had to read through thousands of words of
terms and conditions for each letter and emoji on your phone. That's
just not scalable.</p>
<p>So it turns out that this is surprisingly complicated. A petition to
Apple is probably not going to be successful.</p>
