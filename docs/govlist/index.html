      Spent $450 million on carbon capture and storage projects (CCS), resulting in every attempted project being cancelled or late, with no carbon actually being captured, mostly because the projects were found to be technically infeasible, financially infeasible, or there just isn't anywhere to store the carbon. The government did not attempt to monitor whether the program successfully captured carbon. Their only success criteria was number of projects funded, regardless of whether the projects work. Even by this measure it was a failure because the committed money ($2 billion) ended up mostly unspent due to project cancellations. The spending program had no conflict of interest safeguards. Coincidentally one of the main Liberal ministers pushing for this cash handout to the fossil fuel industry left parliament for a job as a lobbyist for the fossil fuel industry.

      Spent $1,400 per person per day to feed asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea. This $82 million contract was paid to a a high-risk shell company owned by PNG political figures, without any competitive tender process. The government did not ask any other company whether they can provide the food for a cheaper price or with less insolvency risk. The government spent far more money than it would have cost to feed the asylum seekers caviar and lobster from a high end restaurant.

      Allocated $44M from the Building Better Futures fund to marginal electorates, through a process that was clearly not merit based (a.k.a. 'pork barrelling'). Projects ranked last for merit were more likely to be funded than ones ranked first. Rejected applications were not told that they ranked higher than the ones that the minister chose. When the audit office asked for an explanation, the government refused.

      Burnt brown coal (the dirtiest kind of coal) and used the electricity to split water to make hydrogen, to export to Japan, then claimed this is green and reduces our emissions. The government contributed $50M to this project which cost $500M overall, to produce only 3 tonnes of hydrogen. The government said "we’re not going to get ideological about it" despite choosing to fund coal-powered hydrogen plants when solar and wind powered hydrogen plants are substantially cheaper.

      Introduced a bill which they called the "anti-trolling" bill, which doesn't even mention trolling. It does not make trolling illegal. It does not give social media companies the power to remove defamatory or troll content. The bill means that moderators of Facebook pages no longer have an obligation to take down troll content, which will help trolling, not hinder it. What this new red tape does do is make it easier to sue social media companies for defamation when their users post mean things. The main change is that social media companies need a way to name accused anonymous users, but the accused users will be allowed to just say 'no'. The powers can only be used if a defamation case is likely (i.e. only for people with a spare $20k lying around), which means this bill won't reduce school-age cyber bullying. The government themselves already hide behind anonymous online accounts to defame political opponents. These changes violate our existing free trade agreements.

The legislation was voted on only hours after giving it to the crossbenchers to review. The legislation was reviewed by intelligence groups, but no public interest privacy advocates. The legislation went against the government's own review into hacking powers. The government rejected a proposal to have a <i>public interest advocate</i> argue on behalf of the hacked person to balance privacy against safety. The argument is that if you've done nothing wrong, you've got nothing to hide. Powers include removing two factor authentication on accounts, thereby making it easier for unrelated criminals to hack those Australians.

      Tried to spend $3.3 million on a feasibility study grant for subsidising a new coal generator. The company who would build it have no relevant experience. The grant criteria was written <i>after</i> the government decided that they would give the money to this company. Previous feasibility studies have shown that the project is too risky and unprofitable for the private sector. It's also not eligible for the government's own Underwriting New Generation Investment program. The government claimed this new generator will reduce power prices for regional Queenslanders specifically, but there is only one wholesale electricity price for all of Queensland, and it's already 50% cheaper than the cost of new coal generation.

So this is like a local plumber demanding that the Yellow Pages pay the plumber for the act of directing plumber-seeking customers to the plumber. This will also undermine the fundamental principles of the web itself, according to its inventor. The laws are written based on the incorrect assumption that news makes up 10% of Google searches when it's only 1%.

When law enforcement unlock a device after demanding a password, they typically don't let the user see what was done, don't tell them what was done, and don't allow them to call a lawyer to find out their rights. In one case a Border Force officer looked through a series of nude photographs of someone's partner, without the consent of the user or person in the photo, made inappropriate comments, and possibly made nonconsentual copies of the photos. If a citizen not suspected of a crime withholds a password to prevent this, they'll be fined.

Regardless of whether the original asylum claims were genuine, if those asylum seekers are returned to their country of origin, they and their family may be imprisoned, tortured or killed because governments and militias in their country of origin will know they sought asylum.
