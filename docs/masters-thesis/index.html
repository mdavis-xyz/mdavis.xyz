      <p>The wholesale price of electricity tends to be far more volatile than
the prices of most other commodities. The main reason is that
electricity cannot be stored cheaply (even with recent advances in
battery technology), so supply and demand must be balanced on the
timescale of seconds. This is coupled with relatively high reliability
requirements compared to most goods, due to the essential nature of the
service. Another reason is that consumers are usually exposed to flat
tariffs. This means that in the short term demand is inelastic. In most
markets an increase in price will increase supply and decrease demand.
In electricity markets an increase in price will barely decrease demand.
Therefore large price variations are required to balance supply and
demand, because only one side of the market responds meaningfully to
short term price signals.</p>
<p>Price volatility can be politically undesirable, as consumers prefer
predictable electricity bills. Investors building generators also tend
to prefer price certainty. However, the large magnitude of variation in
electricity spot prices reflects how the true cost and value to society
of electricity consumption varies drastically over hours, minutes and
even within a single second. Some units of energy (megawatt hours) are
worth ten thousand times more than others, due to a difference in when
they are delivered. Consumers and generators often face incentives which
do not reflect this variation. The purpose of this thesis is to
investigate such missing markets, and market design failures, through a
series of example cases, with a focus on Europe and Australia.</p>
<p>This thesis is the culmination of a two-year <a
href="https://www.tse-fr.eu/master-environmental-economics-and-policy">Master
of Environmental Policy and Energy Economics</a> at <a
href="https://www.tse-fr.eu/">the Toulouse School of Economics
(TSE)</a>, in France. It was written from March to August 2025 under the
supervision of <a
href="https://www.tse-fr.eu/people/francois-salanie">Professor François
Salanié</a>.</p>
<p>Through this thesis I have combined the economic theory taught in
this masters course with my experience in the industry to generate
several interesting insights. I designed several formal algebraic models
for this thesis. A key challenge for theoreticians when constructing
such models is to simplify the problem enough to be tractable, whilst
retaining enough complexity and nuance to capture the true nature and
tradeoffs of the problem. My experience in electricity trading and
dispatch inspired these models and helps ensure their relevance. In
addition to theoretical models, this thesis also includes a policy
review of capacity markets. This entails the collation of many facts to
distil a complex issue into a research-driven story.</p>
<p>Most parts of this thesis include data analysis, either to motivate
the problem or test a model. Regressions were performed in R. Data
wrangling, simulations and exploratory analysis and graphing was done
with Python. The code for all simulations and regressions is available
on <a
href="https://github.com/mdavis-xyz/masters-thesis">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Part 1 explores payments for spinning reserves, also known as
contingency raise services. Payments for reserves are somewhat unique to
the electricity sector. Dairy farmers are not paid for the ability to
increase production in case their neighbour's production drops
unexpectedly. Electricity generators are. This is due to the fact that
after a large shock, electricity supply and demand must be balanced on a
subsecond timescale. (The reserves may also be called upon after a
demand shock or transmission outage.)</p>
<p>A contribution of Part 1 is the clear explanation for a non-technical
reader of the difference between spinning reserves and stationary
reserves. This is followed by an algebraic derivation of the equilibrium
cost of reserves. This model is based on <a
href="https://doi.org/10.5547/01956574.45.1.jgil">Gilmore, Nolan, and
Simshauser (2024)</a>, but is extended in several respects. Increasing
marginal costs are used instead of a constant marginal cost. The model
includes a fixed operating cost component and the possibility of a
generator turning off completely, to model the important distinction
between stationary and spinning reserves. The model is extended to make
demand for reserves endogenous, depending on demand for energy. The
nature of this endogeneity is tested empirically with ARIMA regressions.
Part 1 also includes mathematical proofs of an intriguing case where
aggregate marginal costs for a good decrease as the quantity demanded
increases. It concludes with a discussion drawing parallels between
ancillary markets for spinning reserves and markets for installed
capacity.</p>
<p>Capacity markets for <em>installed</em> capacity are a hot topic in
the industry at the moment. In theory an energy-only market (where
generators are paid only per unit of energy they produce) should drive
investment to the optimal level. Proponents of capacity markets argue
that the energy-only paradigm yields insufficient revenue in practice,
resulting in underinvestment. This can only be true if there is a market
failure, or a missing market. However, many proponents are unable to
precisely identify such a cause.</p>
<p>Part 2 is a literature review and discussion of the potential market
failures and missing markets which motivate the introduction of capacity
markets. The most pertinent market failure is the presence of an
inefficiently low spot price cap. The most relevant missing market is
typically the absence or low liquidity of long term hedging markets. The
section explores how capacity markets often fail to achieve their
objectives. They are often designed without regard for the reliability
targets which they are supposed to achieve, and they can exacerbate the
very &quot;missing money&quot; problem which they are intended to solve. Part 2
also includes a discussion of how the metric for capacity is quite
difficult to define in a way which does not create perverse incentives.
Capacity payment metrics typically lead to operational and investment
distortions, rewarding poor performers who contribute little energy
during critical periods. This metric is typically defined in a way which
explicitly discriminates based on fuel type, directly counteracting
climate policy objectives, and is effectively a departure from a
liberalised market to one of a central planner picking winners. Part 2
includes an analysis of data showing trends in capture price ratios, as
a demonstration of how two generators with the same capacity can provide
vastly different social value.</p>
<p><a href="../solar-tilt">Part 3</a> explores these differences in the
value of a megawatt within a given fuel type, from a theoretical
perspective. It does so by introducing a model concerning the angle
which solar panels are mounted at. Conventional wisdom says that panels
should be installed at an angle equal to their latitude, and facing
north/south towards the equator. This maximises the volume of energy
produced. However, a panel which faces further west and more vertically,
produces more energy in winter and late afternoons, when each unit of
energy is more valuable. This tradeoff is explored in the model to
demonstrate how the objective of investment should be to maximise the
<em>value</em> of energy produced, not the <em>volume</em>. This is
coupled with simulations showing that rooftop solar support schemes can
distort this tradeoff such that up to half the social value of solar
panels is wasted.</p>
<p>The model from Part 3 is then extended in Part 4 to combine solar
panels with a battery. The purpose of this extension is to challenge the
common misconception that combining solar panels with a battery
increases the project's spot market revenue. Batteries do indeed add
value by acting as a 'solar sponge', shifting surplus generation from
the middle of the day when prices are low and the sun is high, to the
afternoon and evening when prices are high and the sun is low or absent.
However, batteries can provide this service without necessarily being
located on the same premise, or even owned by the same firm or
household. There are many logistical benefits from installing solar and
batteries together (&quot;colocation&quot;). The purpose of this model is to
demonstrate that from a pure spot market revenue perspective, colocation
provides no increase in revenue, and may even reduce revenue, compared
to solar and batteries installed separately.</p>
<p>Many of the challenges and quirks of electricity markets are due to
the fact that most consumers pay a price for energy which is different
to the marginal cost to produce that energy. Due to a strong political
aversion to bill shock and the historical impracticalities of real time
metering, customers face a fixed tariff instead of the wholesale price.
Part 5 introduces a model, based on a simplification of <a
href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4135226">Borenstein and Holland
(2005)</a>, to explore the inefficiency which this creates.</p>
<p>Electricity retailers offer these fixed tariffs to consumers, and are
exposed to the variable wholesale price. This introduces a risk, which
depends on the joint distribution of spot prices and consumers' daily
consumption profiles. Part 6 explores the risk-return tradeoff of a
retailer choosing an optimal portfolio of heterogenous customers.
Parallels then are drawn to show that this is similar to to the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model">Capital
Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</a>.</p>
<p>In Part 7 the discussion returns to the supply side. In electricity
spot markets the price changes abruptly at the boundary between trading
intervals, but the physical output of electricity generators cannot
change instantaneously. Technical limits on the rate of adjustment
(ramping) of generators have been well studied in the engineering and
economic literature. However, some markets such as Australia's National
Electricity Market (NEM) specify a minimum duration for adjustment, even
if the generator is physically capable of adjusting far more quickly.
Part 7 explores the impact of this limit. A unique contribution of this
section is to show that even with perfect foresight, no market power, no
startup costs and no <em>physical</em> ramp rate limits, a rational
profit-maximising firm may still want to submit bids which differ from
their marginal cost. Additionally, an algebraic model is introduced to
demonstrate that this ramping constraint mutes the incentives created by
price spikes. Many researchers and market participants ignore this
limitation imposed by the market operator. Part 7 concludes with
simulations in Australia's NEM, to show empirically that the impact of
this limit on modelling results can be economically significant.</p>
