      <p>Maximizing solar energy volume is the wrong goal. We should maximize
value.</p>
<p>I've been thinking a lot recently about vertical solar. Mounting
solar panels vertically can give some engineering benefits, however I
think these aspects pale in comparison to the value that comes from
shifting when a solar panel produces power to when consumers need
it.</p>
<p>For a fixed-tilt system, conventional wisdom is to mount a panel at
an angle equal to the latitude, and pointed north/south (towards the
equator). If you face it more to the west and more vertically, you
reduce the total volume of energy produced, but can increase the total
value, by capturing more of the evening spot price peak. You also
produce more during winter, when solar power is more scarce.</p>
<p>I've run some simulations on NEM data for 2024, considering every
possible orientation of fixed-tilt solar panels (horizontal to vertical,
and N/S/E/W). The orientation that maximizes revenue is roughly halfway
between the one that maximizes volume (conventional wisdom) and the one
which maximizes capture price. In Queensland a panel's spot revenue can
be almost doubled by pointing it more vertically, and more westward.
That's a huge increase in value to society. The causation is simple. As
more and more solar is installed and generating at midday, the value of
each additional panel producing at midday keeps dropping, whilst
generation during the late afternoon becomes more scarce. I haven't done
the calculations yet, but I expect the difference in marginal emissions
abatement to be even larger than doubling.</p>

<p>Despite these huge differences, rooftop solar around the world is
typically rewarded with flat rates per kWh, or per kW, so home owners
maximize volume, and society loses up to half of the panels' value. For
my masters thesis I am looking at how we can improve subsidy design to
address this.</p>
<p>Most large-scale farms use single-axis tracking. As panel prices
continue to drop relative to tracking systems, I expect fixed-tilt
panels will become more popular (especially fully-vertical bifacial
panels). I wonder how many PPA negotiations discuss setting the
orientation to maximize volume (best for the owner, for a given PPA
price) vs maximizing revenue (best for the offtaker, which should lead
them to offer a higher PPA price).</p>
<p>These are pretty rough simulations, only using the trigonometry of
the sun position. I've neglected diffuse light, weather and some
atmospheric effects. Given how substantial the results are in the
simplified model, I expect the overall story would remain the same with
more sophisticated modelling.</p>
<p>The code for the simulations is available <a
href="https://gitlab.com/MatthewDavis/solar-tilt#">on GitLab</a>. This
work is part of my masters thesis, which is ongoing at the time of
writing.</p>
