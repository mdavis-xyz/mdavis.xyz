      <p>The purpose of an election is to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>fairly decide a winner; and</li>
<li>convince everyone that the decision was fair.</li>
</ol>
<p>If anyone can exploit a security vulnerability in voting machines or
online voting systems, they can modify the individual votes or the final
count such that the wrong candidate wins. There are some insurmountable
theoretical security issues with electronic voting which can
<em>never</em> be resolved. Worse still is that in practice voting
machines and online voting are consistently insecure against even the
most basic attacks, due to a shocking lack of due diligence by many
different electoral organisations. This means that electronic voting is
far less likely to correctly select the winner than paper counted
manually.</p>
<p>Not only is election fraud easier to execute with electronic
elections, but it is also harder to detect. The stakes for national
elections are very high, and the threats are very real. Elections which
lack a paper trail cannot be re-counted. Voters are typically not
allowed to inspect and verify the software and devices used to log and
count their votes. Instead they must blindly trust all the people in the
supply chain, and each electoral official. Even if inspection was
allowed, it is scientifically impossible to <em>confirm</em> that any
non-trivial electronic device has not been infected with malware. This
means that the integrity of any electronic election is not trustworthy.
There is not much point in holding an election unless the people trust
the outcome, and believe in the process.</p>

<h2 id="comparing-banking-and-voting">Comparing Banking and Voting</h2>
<p>Many people ask the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If I can securely do my banking online, why can't I cast my vote
online?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The short answer is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>banking and elections have two very different threat models;
and</li>
<li>elections have a unique anonymity requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cryptography is <em>not</em> the primary defence which keeps your
money safe when banking online. The primary security measure is the fact
that <em>when</em> your account gets <a
href="https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html">cracked</a>, your
bank will just pay you back, out of their own pocket. They will cop that
as an operational loss, because doing so is cheaper than implementing
extreme security measures.</p>
<p>One big difference in requirements between commerce and voting is
that of anonymity. An electoral system must make it impossible for
anyone to find out how you voted, even if you want to show them. If
demonstrating how you voted were possible, voters could be coerced.
(e.g. &quot;Vote for Party X or else I will hurt you.&quot;) If it is impossible
for you to show them how you voted, then you can still vote how you want
and just lie about it afterwards, thus making coercion ineffective.</p>
<p>An electoral system must separate your identity and the fact that you
have cast your vote, from the content of your vote. Banks never have
this problem. They never want to authorise a transaction without
simultaneously knowing how much money is moving and who the parties are.
Consequently bank fraud is very easy to detect. Either:</p>
<ul>
<li>the total account balance does not equal the sum of all past
transaction; or</li>
<li>there is a transaction which the account owner does not
recognise.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several types of electronic voting:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fully online voting (using a website or app on your own device)</li>
<li>Paperless voting machines in poll booths</li>
<li>Machines which count paper ballots (and possibly a second machine to
print the paper)</li>
</ol>
<p>For the online option you could implement a verification system, so
that after casting your vote from one device, you log in on another and
ask the server to tell you what it thinks your vote is. If this is
possible then your vote is not truly anonymous, so coercion becomes
possible, which is not acceptable.</p>
<p>For the first two options (which are paperless), it is <em>literally
impossible</em> to detect most fraud if it happens, unless you give up
anonymity. Of course election fraud is <em>sometimes</em> easy to
detect, like the time multiple vote counting machines submitted <a
href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2004/03/diebolds-political-machine/"><em>negative</em>
votes</a> for Al Gore. However it only takes <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_close_election_results">a
dozen flipped votes</a> at a carefully chosen electorate to change the
outcome of the whole election. How could you detect that? If the outcome
is a close call, or the integrity of the machines is in doubt, you
cannot do a re-count. The possibility of a recount is one of the main
essential features you lose if you abandon paper.</p>
<p>Some <a
href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2018/10/19/continuous-roll-vvpat-under-glass-an-idea-whose-time-has-passed/">&quot;VVPAT&quot;</a>
systems use a digital touch screen for voter input, and then print a
paper ballot, which is mechanically dropped into a sealed box. This
allows voters to see their vote printed (without touching it), to ensure
the machine did not change their vote. However what happens if a voter
claims the vote they saw printed was not what they selected? Do you stop
all voting on that machine, all machines in that polling place, all
machines in the country? What if the voter just mis-remembered what they
chose? What if the voter lied in a deliberate attempt to disrupt voting
in a crucial electorate? There is no way to know.</p>
<p>Some systems use a voting machine to provide a simpler and nicer
interface than paper. They print a ballot, which the voter can inspect
and then insert into the box by hand. However in practice half of voters
don't check, and most who do check <a
href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3292208">don't
notice errors</a> anyway. Ultimately such a system is <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI">just a very expensive
pencil</a>.</p>
<p>It might seem like this does not matter if you just make sure that
the devices don't get compromised in the first place. However recounting
is a safety net which provides an extra layer of security. All good
security systems use multiple layers of protection for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_%28computing%29">Defence
in Depth</a> (like multiple concentric walls protecting a castle).
Furthermore as enumerated below, it is impossible in practice and even
in theory to defend against the kind of bad actors which elections
face.</p>
<p>A bank only needs to defend themselves against <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie">script kiddies</a>,
and at worst organised crime gangs. Election officials must defend their
system against foreign nation states. Their enemies are as powerful as
the <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security">NSA</a>,
and <a
href="https://www.wired.com/story/russia-election-hacking-playbook/">Russia's
Kremlin</a>. The stakes for big elections are <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI">literally
<em>trillions</em> of dollars</a>, so the enemies will be willing to
spend comparable amounts of money to change the outcome. Examples of
attacks which are only used when nation states are involved and the
stakes are this high include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">STUXNET</a>
attack, where the US and Israeli governments managed to inject malware
into a computer which was completely offline, by using infected USB
drives, and multiple <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)">zero-day
exploits</a></li>
<li>the time America's NSA deliberately lobbied standards group to adopt
an encryption algorithm <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG">they already knew how
to break</a>, which was subsequently used in important systems all over
the world</li>
<li>the <a

attack</a>, where governments mimic mobile towers to execute <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Man-In-The-Middle
attacks</a> on the 2G network. (Many voting machines transmit vote
totals <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/magazine/the-myth-of-the-hacker-proof-voting-machine.html">over
the 2G network</a>.)</li>
<li>Governments can use laws like <a
href="https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/bills/r6195_aspassed/toc_pdf/18204b01.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22legislation/bills/r6195_aspassed/0000%22">Australia's

href="https://thenextweb.com/politics/2018/12/10/australias-horrific-new-encryption-law-likely-to-obliterate-its-tech-scene/One/">to
secretly install backdoors in their systems</a>, for products which end
up being used as part of a foreign elections. (Government's around the
world are <a

Huawei routers and devices</a> from critical infrastructure, solely
because they are worried China will use this exact attack vector.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Scariest of all is the <a href="./KTH.pdf">Ken Thompson Hack</a>.
Someone may write innocent and strong software for a voting machine, but
if that software developer's laptop was infected with this kind of worm,
the compiled (computer readable) version of their code can be modified
to be different to the human readable code which they wrote. For
example, the worm could tell the voting machine to change every tenth
vote for Party X to a vote for Party Y. The shocking thing about this is
that since it is impossible to convert any non-trivial computer code
back to human-readable form, this attack is undetectable. Since some
software on every computer originated from another computer (which could
be infected), it is <em>theoretically impossible</em> to know with
certainty that any device has not been infected. This attack is
difficult to execute in practice. However when <em>trillions</em> of
dollars are on the line, and large foreign governments want to sway the
outcome, it becomes a realistic threat.</p>
<p>Banks do not need to worry about these kinds of attacks, because
their attackers are less formidable.</p>

prevent. However in practice, the actual state of online voting and
voting machine security is far, far worse. Electronic voting systems are

<p>If you can think of a way voting machines or online voting could go
wrong, then there is almost certainly an example of an actual real
election where exactly that has happened. Some real elections have used
machines which:</p>
<ul>
<li>transmit vote counts to the central office <em>without any
encryption</em> (This is like stapling a $100 note to a postcard and
expecting it to get to the destination.)

by an amount which was a power of two.</p>
<p>That is what happens with devices designed and used solely for
elections, secured by dedicated electoral organisations whose job is to
keep the devices secure. Online voting where voters can cast their vote
using an app or website on their own consumer device will necessarily be
worse, because consumer devices are less diligently secured and contain
a lot more code and features. Many actual elections which have used
online voting have had real production servers taken over by attackers,
easily.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Within 36 hours of the system going live, our team had found and
exploited a vulnerability that gave us almost total control of the
server software, including the ability to change votes and reveal
voters' secret ballots.&quot; - Prof. J. Alex Halderman, computer scientist
<a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2010/10/05/hacking-dc-internet-voting-pilot/" target="_blank"><img src="images/link-dark.svg" alt="source" height="128" width="128" class="link-icon" /></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to viewing and modifying votes, these researchers left a
deliberately obvious calling card, by making the voting page play their
Universities fight song. The officials <a
href="https://www.thenation.com/article/american-democracy-is-now-under-siege-by-both-cyber-espionage-and-gop-voter-suppression/"><em>didn't
even notice</em></a> this deliberately obvious attack until two days
later.</p>
<p>There is at least one example of a real election server being
attacked by a malicious attacker <a
href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/whitehouse/barrs-conclusion-no-obstruction-gets-new-scrutiny">using
SQL injection</a>. This is <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp">the oldest trick
in the book</a>. Such vulnerabilities are so well known and easy to
prevent that it would be shocking to see on a read-only blog, let alone
an electoral system.</p>
<p>Australian elections mostly use paper, but the state of New South
Wales offers an online <a
href="https://www.ivote.nsw.gov.au/"><em>iVote</em></a> system for
overseas voters. The makers of this site chose to load a third party
analytics tool <a
href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2015/03/22/ivote-vulnerability/">inside
the vote page</a>. Such tools are designed to provide insight about
visitor behaviour to website operators. (e.g. &quot;40% of visitors leave
before scrolling to the bottom of the page.&quot;) These tools are nominally
passive, however it would be trivial for that vendor to modify their
code to read your vote, modify anything on the page, or even modify your
vote directly. This code was <a
href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2015/03/22/ivote-vulnerability/">loaded
insecurely</a>, so anyone who compromises this monitoring tool could
change visitors' votes. Furthermore, the main iVote home page prior to
the actual ballot page <a
href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2015/03/22/ivote-vulnerability/">was
not encrypted at all</a>, so an attacker could just hijack <em>that</em>
page and then direct you to a malicious page which looks like the real
one and still makes your browser show a green padlock icon.</p>
<p>Most consumer devices (such as phones and laptops) are <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI"><em>already</em>
infected</a> with relatively simple malware. If consumers cannot protect
themselves from malware made by simple individual attackers, how could
they possibly defend against malware made by a foreign nation's
military, specifically for the purpose of election rigging? If you cast
a vote on a device which is infected with something, you cannot know
that what you see on the screen matches the data which is actually sent
to the server.</p>
<p>Computers can perform checksums and hashes to &quot;fingerprint&quot; their
software and ensure it matches the official fingerprint. However if the
device is infected such that an attacker can change your vote, then it
is easy for them to also change the fingerprint calculation, thereby
hiding their tracks.</p>
<p>The only way to mitigate this is to allow users to subsequently
request a confirmation of who they voted for (such as from a different
device). If this is possible then your vote is not anonymous, so
coercion becomes possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is technologically impossible to meaningfully
separate the fact that you voted (to prevent double-voting) from
<em>who</em> you voted for (anonymity).</p>
<p>How can election officials be sure that people who cast their vote on
their laptop at home did not have an abusive partner looking over their
shoulder and forcing them to vote for a particular candidate? When
voting only happens in private booths inside public rooms, this is not a
problem.</p>
<h2 id="how-big-a-flaw-is-big-enough">How Big a Flaw is Big Enough?</h2>
<p>You only need to fudge <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_close_election_results">a
few votes</a> in a carefully chosen electorate to sway the whole
election. You need to modify even fewer to destroy trust in the
system.</p>
<h2 id="could-a-blockchain-fix-security-issues">Could a Blockchain Fix
Security Issues?</h2>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Blockchains <a href="../blockchain">do not make elections more
secure</a>. Many people such as <a href="https://www.voteflux.org/">The
Flux Party</a> have <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525995-attack-of-the-50-foot-blockchain">drunk
the blockchain Kool-Aid</a> and now throw around the buzzword <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4jv75a/to_the_journalists_who_are_new_to_the_scene_the/">without
any pronoun</a> as if it will magically fix all problems.</p>
<p>All software contains bugs. Blockchain software is <em>consistently
worse</em> than normal software. Blockchain apps are typically written
in Solidity, which is one of the most <a
href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/ethereum-smart-contracts-in-practice/">awful
and error-prone</a> programming languages of all time.</p>
<p>The very reason blockchains were invented is antithetical to
elections. Blockchains were designed to be public, immutable and fully
distributed. Normally with blockchain applications, if someone steals
your password they <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8dnbeh/coins_gone_hope_you_learn_from_my_mistake/">permanently
take control of your account</a>. For an election this means someone
else can spend your vote for this election and all subsequent elections.
If it is possible for the electoral agency to perform a password reset,
then a single centralised party has the ability to block and modify
writes to the database. Blockchains were invented to prevent <em>exactly
that</em> from being possible. So if password resets are possible, <a
href="../blockchain">there's no point using a blockchain</a>.</p>
<h2 id="could-regulation-fix-security-issues">Could Regulation Fix
Security Issues?</h2>
<p>As explained above, the Ken Thompson hack means that some malware can
infiltrate systems and remain undetected by even well funded, well
trained people using world's best practice. All the practical
implementation flaws enumerated above also remain despite
regulation.</p>
<p>In most US jurisdictions it is illegal to connect machines to the
Internet. However vendors consistently use channels which are equally or
less secure, such as unencrypted 2G phone calls, <a
href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2018/02/22/are-voting-machine-modems-truly-divorced-from-the-internet/">vulnerable
to man-in-the-middle attacks</a>.</p>
<p>It is typically illegal to install remote desktop software on voting
machines in the US. However one vendor <a
href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mb4ezy/top-voting-machine-vendor-admits-it-installed-remote-access-software-on-systems-sold-to-states">did
it anyway</a>, and then lied about it. The software they installed
allows <a
href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-018/">remote
execution of arbitrary code</a>. This tool was so insecure that the
company who makes it <a
href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2618965/threatened-by-anonymous--symantec-tells-users-to-pull-pcanywhere-s-plug.html">recommends
not using it</a>. The machine makers claim they had no knowledge of that
software, so how did it get there? How can you patch code you don't know
is there? Either the machine makers were malicious or incompetent. Both
possibilities are bad.</p>
<p>Many of the prior examples were from the US because they are one of
the biggest users of digital voting systems. However these issues have
cropped up in other regulatory jurisdictions too, such as <a
href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15190148">Germany</a>, <a
href="https://media.ccc.de/v/31c3_-_6344_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201412281400_-_security_analysis_of_estonia_s_internet_voting_system_-_j_alex_halderman">Estonia</a>
and <a
href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2015/03/22/ivote-vulnerability/">Australia</a>.</p>
<p>In practice voting machines are typically regulated, audited,
inspected and secured <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/13/opinion/gambling-on-voting.html"><em>less</em>
diligently than gambling machines</a>.</p>
<h2 id="commercial-vendors-and-proprietary-software">Commercial Vendors
and Proprietary Software</h2>
<p>It only takes a few lines of code to turn innocent vote counting
software into malicious vote-flipping software. The first step for any
regulator would be to insist upon the use of only public, open-source
code. That way regulators and voters could see that the code which is
<em>supposed</em> to eventually end up counting votes is not malicious.
However this never happens. In practice voting software is always <a
href="https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/363417/governments_must_abandon_proprietary_software_stallman/">proprietary</a>.
This means it is secret. Vendors refuse to show the code to security
researchers, let alone average citizens. In some cases it is even <a
href="https://www.thenation.com/article/touch-and-go-elections-perils-electronic-voting/"><em>illegal</em></a>
for security researchers to try to probe such software for
vulnerabilities. (Such laws won't stop bad guys from finding
vulnerabilities to rig the election with, but they <a
href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40448876/how-hackers-are-teaching-election-officials-to-protect-their-voting-machines-learned-from-hackers-to-improve-security-for-future-elections">will
stop good guys</a> from finding those vulnerabilities and fixing them
first.)</p>
<p>Recall the second reason why elections take place. Voters who support
the losing party must be convinced that the decision was fair and
democratic. If you have voting machines, this means that they must be
convinced the machines were not compromised. How can voters trust the
election results when the method of counting and verifying their votes
is secret?</p>
<p>Imagine if you cast your vote by making a phone call to a human,
telling them your vote. Then at the end of the day that person calls the
central office and says what their totals were. That's crazy. That's
insane. That's obviously a <em>terrible</em>, <em>fundamentally
fucked</em> idea. But that's effectively <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI">how all proprietary
voting software works</a>.</p>
<p>In the 2016 Australian federal election ballots were counted by
machines inside the vendor's building. The vendor <a
href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/aec-s-vote-counting-machines-impossible-to-check-for-accuracy-scrutineers">refused
to let most official scrutineers in</a> to see all the counting machines
operating, instead only allowing a small number of scrutineers watch a
minority of the machines. The scanning performed by Fuji Xerox machines
was 'checked' by Fuji Xerox employees, in only a few seconds per ballot.
For the few ballot scans which were seen by scrutineers, if scrutineers
objected after the vendor staff already clicked next, it was
<em>impossible</em> for the staff to go back to that prior ballot and
correct it. Thankfully the electoral commission ended up recounting all
ballots by hand. However they <a
href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/damning-report-finds-aec-bungled-security-in-2016-election-costing-millions">never
bothered</a> to figure out just how many mistakes were made by the
machines.</p>
<p>By choosing to use proprietary voting systems, <strong>governments
are giving control of the election to a private company who have a
strong financial incentive to hide known vulnerabilities and prevent
security researchers from finding bugs.</strong></p>

<p>All software has bugs (coding mistakes), typically around <a
href="https://www.mayerdan.com/ruby/2012/11/11/bugs-per-line-of-code-ratio">ten
to fifty bugs</a> for every thousand lines of code. Voting machines
typically have <a
href="https://mirror.netcologne.de/CCC/congress/2014/webm-sd/31c3-6344-en-Security_Analysis_of_Estonias_Internet_Voting_System_webm-sd.webm">several
hundred thousand lines of code</a>. Therefore we can say with high
confidence that any voting machines probably has <em>thousands</em> of
bugs. The consequences of using software with so many bugs to run an
election are catastrophic. The video above is from a <em>real</em>
election. This example is <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/magazine/the-myth-of-the-hacker-proof-voting-machine.html">one
of many</a> where the screen displayed a different vote to what the
voter intended. For online voting, votes are cast on consumer devices
running tens of millions of lines of code, which means they contain
<em>hundreds of thousands of bugs</em>. These problems do not happen
with paper ballots.</p>
<p>In March a dozen European Union members cast their vote incorrectly,
because the user interface of the voting systems did not make it clear
whether they were voting on amendments or the whole bill. The
consequence is that <a
href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/04/01/meps-just-voted-through-controversial-copyright-clauses-by-mistake/">legislation
not supported by the majority was passed</a>, and Internet freedom all
around the world was impacted as a result. This happened to politicians
whose entire job is voting, and understanding the process. So how could
an average person voting once a year or less possibly fare any
better?</p>
<p>In one Texas election the machines took many seconds to render each
page on the screen. If voters touched the screen before that rendering
finished, the machine silently <a
href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/negayg/texas-voting-machines-have-been-a-known-problem-for-a-decade">threw
away their vote</a>. The officials' response was to claim nothing was
wrong, and to blame voters for not waiting &quot;at least three to five
seconds for all choices to be rendered&quot;. If a computer takes five
seconds to print some simple text on a screen from a local drive, then
something is fundamentally wrong with how that software was written.</p>
<p>Paper ballots are incredibly cheap. The ballot costs a few cents, and
the cardboard booths and pencils cost a few dollars. So polling places
can afford to install as many as they can fit into the room. In
Australia many voters can walk straight in, and it's rare to queue for
more than twenty minutes. In contrast, voting machines cost <a
href="https://www.thenation.com/article/touch-and-go-elections-perils-electronic-voting/">several
thousand dollars each</a>, so there tend to be fewer booths per polling
place. Consequently voter throughput is lower, so voters frequently
queue for <a
href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0810/0810.5577.pdf">many
<em>hours</em></a>. This discourages voters, which is bad for
democracy.</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-paper">The Benefits of Paper</h2>
<p>In the 2000 US presidential election paper ballot counting machines
miscounted a substantial amount of votes, because of the <a
href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hanging%20chad">hanging
chad issue</a>. The consequence was that the elected president was <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_recount_in_Florida">quite
possibly <em>not</em></a> the president who received the most votes.
This would not have happened if the ballots had been marked and counted
by hand.</p>
<p>Rather than go back to manual counting the US doubled down on
electronic voting, of all types. It is now common for elections in the
US to use two stage systems with paper in between, or direct vote
systems with no paper, or <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI">even <em>email</em>
ballots</a>. (Most email is completely unencrypted. It is trivial to
send an email and make it look like someone else sent it. So this is as
secure as voting via postcard.)</p>
<p>The method of physical voting with paper ballots and manual counting
is centuries old. Pretty much all attacks have already been tried,
discovered, and defended against. For example, the reason you are given
a pencil not a pen is to defend against the possibility of voters
swapping pens for ones with <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI">disappearing ink</a>.
That is the level of paranoia which electoral systems <em>should</em>
have.</p>
<p>Even if someone does manage to commit election fraud with paper, the
impact would probably be constrained to just one ballot box or just one
polling booth. Whereas if an electronic election is compromised, the
attacker can influence the <em>entire</em> count. For example, many
voting machines have the candidate list loaded on each election using an
SD card, which is inserted into all machines, one after the other. It is
<a
href="https://mirror.netcologne.de/CCC/congress/2014/webm-sd/31c3-6344-en-Security_Analysis_of_Estonias_Internet_Voting_System_webm-sd.webm">relatively
simple</a> to construct a virus such that if you infect just one
machine, any inserted SD card will be infected, which will infect all
subsequent machines programmed with that card.</p>
<p>Paper ballots are typically counted by you, ordinary citizens. The
staff and scrutineers are people from across the political spectrum. In
contrast most voting machines are made by only a handful of vendors, who
are <a
href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2004/03/diebolds-political-machine/">highly
partisan</a>. The CEO of one publicly proclaimed that he will be
&quot;helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the President.&quot;</p>
<p>If you are concerned that the people counting your vote will
deliberately fudge the numbers, you can simply walk into the polling
place and watch them, or participate in the count (if you register in
advance). If you are concerned about a voting machine, there is nothing
you can do.</p>
<p>For systems which have no paper trail, there is no possibility of a
recount. You are forced to blindly trust the integrity and competency of
everyone in the supply chain, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>vendors</li>
<li>upstream hardware makers overseas</li>
<li>officials</li>
<li>everyone who has access to the machine in the years between
elections</li>
<li>every voter who had private physical access to the machine when they
voted</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>For systems which print out a paper receipt for you but submit the
vote digitally, you cannot know whether the machine flipped your vote in
the digital record, but printed your intended vote on the receipt.</p>
<p>For ballot counting machines, what happens if you want to recount
because you question the machine's integrity? You cannot recount with
the same machine, because that will give you the same possibly-corrupt
answer. What about another machine in the same polling place? If the
first machine was infected, that one could be too. What about another
machine in another polling place? That's probably made by the same
vendor, with the same flaws.</p>
<p>It only takes a few extra bytes of code to turn legitimate vote
counting software into vote-flipping software. It is impossible to
convert non-trivial ones and zero back into human readable form. Voting
machines are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box">black
box</a>.</p>
<p>One of the challenging problems which paper solves is ensuring that
each person votes only once, that vote definitely ends up in the count,
and no one can see how any individual voted. This works well with paper
ballots, marked by hand. No other system has been invented which
satisfies this constraint well.</p>
<h2 id="the-motivation">The Motivation</h2>
<p>One significant motivation for electronic voting is to make the
counting process faster. But why do we need to rush? In the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Australian_federal_election">2016
Australian federal election</a> it took <em>4 weeks</em> until results
were finalised. The nation did not falter. The sky did not fall.
Parliament steers the nation on a time-scale of years, so waiting hours
or even weeks for a count is not of great consequence.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, voting machines are <em>expensive</em>. In the
2016 Australian federal election, distrust in the vote scanning machines
resulted in a manual recount, at a cost of $8.6 million. That is <a
href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/damning-report-finds-aec-bungled-security-in-2016-election-costing-millions"><em>less</em></a>
than the cost of merely <em>transporting</em> the ballots to the digital
scanning centres ($8.7 million). The cost of designing and building the
digital scanning system was $27 million. So cost reduction is an invalid
motivation for electronic voting.</p>
<p>Another motivation for online voting is convenience for voters. As
mentioned earlier, voting with paper is <a
href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0810/0810.5577.pdf">quicker</a>
than voting with machines. So the only convenience increase for voters
is if they are out of town on election day and they can vote online.
Such voters can already cast a vote in the weeks prior. This is
increasingly popular, with <a
href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-15/federal-election-pre-poll-votes-could-delay-antony-green-result/11114492">three
million voters</a> doing so in the 2019 election. Convenience is
important. However online voting violates both of the original goals of
an election (fair decision, which everyone trusts is fair), and we
already have workarounds for people out of town on election day.
Citizens in Australia cast a vote for any level of government about once
per year, and the stakes are very high. Therefore the trade-off is not
worth it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The purpose of an election is to fairly choose a winner, and convince
everyone that it was a fair decision.</p>
<p>Electronic voting has fundamental theoretical security issues, so you
can <em>never</em> be sure the decision was fair. In practice voting
machines and online voting are consistently implemented with shocking
security, far from best practice. Every vulnerability you can think of
has probably been found on a real system.</p>
<p>Paper voting and manual counting has been used and refined over
<em>centuries</em>. Electronic voting is more expensive, and involves
handing control of the election to a partisan for-profit vendor who has
a strong incentive to hide security vulnerabilities and reduce cost by
cutting corners.</p>
<p>There is no real need to expedite the process. The sky doesn't fall
if counting takes a while.</p>
<p>If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Electronic voting isn't even a fix.
Time and time again it has failed to even come close to the security and
usability of paper ballots, counted manually.</p>
