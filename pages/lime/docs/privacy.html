      The  Steps We Take To Keep Personal Information Secure

   </h3>
   <p>
      We are concerned about ensuring the  security of Your Personal
      Information. We exercise great care in providing  secure transmission of
      Your information from Your device to Our servers. We  store Personal
      Information that We have collected in secure operating  environments
      that are not available to the public. Our security procedures mean  that
      We may occasionally request proof of identity before We disclose Your
      Personal Information to You. We try Our best to safeguard Your Personal
      Information once We receive it, but please understand that no
      transmission of  data over the Internet or any other public network can
      be guaranteed to be 100%  secure. <br>

   </div>
   <h3>
      How  Can We Transfer Your Personal Information?

   </h3>
   <p>
      As We offer Our Services in many  locations globally, We may transfer
      your Personal Information to or from these  locations for the purposes
      of providing you Services. The exact location of  where your personal
      data will be transferred depends on the location where you  receive
      Service. A list of these locations is on Our website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181129080104/https://www.li.me/locations?hsLang=en-us">https://www.li.me/locations

      </a>
      .

   </p>
   <p>
      Many of the countries to which Your  personal information may be
      transferred for these purposes that are located  outside the EU do not
      benefit from an adequacy decision issued by the EU  Commission regarding
      protection afforded to personal information in that  country. Details
      of these specific countries can be found here:
      https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en.
      <br>
      These transfers are made either as  they are necessary for the
      performance of a contract to which you will be a  party, or for
      pre-contractual measures. Alternatively, adequacy of data  protection is
      ensured by standard data protection clauses that we have in place  with
      the relevant recipient. A copy of these standard data protection
      clauses  may be requested by emailing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181129080104/mailto:legal@li.me">legal@li.me

      </a>
      .

   </p>
   <p>
      In addition, the information We  collect from you may be transferred
      to, and stored by, IT vendors who operate  on our behalf, particularly
      to those located in the United States. We also  transfer information to a
      number of providers of business application – such as  CRM and
      marketing applications – as well marketing service providers.&nbsp;
      These providers are primarily located in the  United States.

   </p>
   <p>
      The United States does not benefit  from a decision issued by the EU
      Commission regarding protection afforded to  personal information.
      Adequacy of data protection is instead ensured by  standard data
      protection clauses we have in place with that third party. A copy  may
      be requested by emailing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181129080104/mailto:legal@li.me">legal@li.me

   <h3>
      How Long We Keep Personal Information

   </h3>
   <p>
      Lime keeps Your Personal  Information for no longer than is
      reasonably necessary or required by law. How  long We keep it depends
      very much on the type of information and purpose.  Following termination
      or deactivation of Your account, Lime, its Clients,  Affiliates, or its
      service providers may retain information (including Your  profile
      information) and user Content for a commercially reasonable time for
      backup, archival, and/or audit purposes.

   </p>
   <p>
      The criteria We use to determine the  retention period for certain categories of data is as follows

   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         the  length of time that You have an account;

      </li>
      <li>
         how  frequently You rent with Us or when You most recent rental occurred;

      </li>
      <li>
         whether  there are contractual or legal obligations that exist that require Us to retain  the data for period of time;

      </li>
      <li>
         whether  there is any ongoing legal claim that relates to any
         rental You have made with  Us, or that is otherwise related to Your
         relationship with Us;

      </li>
      <li>
         whether  any applicable law, statute, or regulation allows for a specific retention  period;

      </li>
      <li>
         whether  the Personal Information is considered to be a special
